# Professional Development

## Choose three skills that resonate with you.

10.  Know the difference between a premature optimization and a show-stopping optimization that NEEDS to happen.  

  This behavior strikes a nerve because I know that I have often been guilty of doing the opposite.  I am very methodical in my approach to completing tasks and I usually have a very detailed plan to obtain my goals.  However, I am frequently visited by the good-idea fairy before I have an opportunity to complete the task at hand.  As I get deeper into my projects, I begin to visualize improvements to my plan.  This not only distracts me from my current plan, but often results in an overhaul that ultimately was not necessary.  It's something I'm aware of and I simply need to do a better job of analyzing the risks and rewards as these *improvements* pop into my head.
  
18.  Always review your own code first.

  I read this one several times, because I feared that I must have misunderstood the point that the author was trying to make.  The Army is big on checking your work and I have always preached, "check your work, double-check it, then check it again."  I couldn't possibly imagine sharing code for review without thoroughly checking it myself.  I would be embarrassed to ask for someone's time to review a project and later find out they were errors that I could have caught and corrected myself.  I believe that a key to success is developing good relationships. Wasting someone's time to go through typo-ridden code is counter-productive in that regard.

24.  Be capable of writing bad code.

  This resonates with me in a manner similar to number 10.  I can often become so fixated with minor details that I will waste hours of working on code that that produces very little in the way of features.  An example of this is naming conventions for classes, IDs, or form elements.  As I begin a project, I will use names that are logical and follow a consistent pattern.  Later on in the project, I may come across a situation where it is difficult to follow the established naming convention.  It is easy for me to take a step backwards to refit my existing names to better suit the new ones...all in the name of semantics.

## Checklists

Checklists have many benefits.  A good to-do list will help you stay organized by allowing you to remain focused on the task at hand without being distracted with concerns for other tasks.  They're written down so you don't need to worry about forgetting them!  Checklists also make you more productive by ensuring that you don't skip any steps in a process.  By simplifying repetitive tasks in a checklist, you are able to use more brain function and concentration on the tasks that require them.  Finally, checklists are great tools for communicating requirements to peers and subordinates.  A good checklist will specify all the steps required, so your teammates know exactly what is needed!

## Strength Based Development

While I'm very excited to return to Turing--an organization that I know to preach and stand behind the the idea--I still can't help but wonder how likely one is to find themself working for a business with a culture that fosters strength-based development.  I may be jaded by 17 years of military experience, where a single weakness can erase a hundred strengths...and a career.  Can an individual, team, or department practice strength-based development in their small part of corporate America in an organization that is set in it's traditional ways?  I'm also looking forward to discussing that talents and motivation are one in the same, as I'm not completely sold on the idea.  After an initial sprint through the front-end program, I better understand the idea at a basic level and I believe that motivation can promote talent.  But I'm not convinced it always works the other way around.  I've been told that I have great customer service skills (talent), but I have absolutely no interest in any kind of customer service jobs.  

Looking back to when I answered these questions nine months ago, it is interesting to compare my introspection to the results of the assessment.  I still believe my greatest strengths are my attention to detail, my ability to play/work well with others, and my perseverance.  However, the assessment shed some light on some other qualities that I may have not considered previously.  One point of interest is that one of my primary themes was maximizer.  Yet, instead of pushing my front-end skills to the limit, here I am broadening my horizons by delving into back-end (of which I still know little). After giving it some thought, I am viewing this as a continuation of exploration.  I anticipate that I will either find an aspect of back-end that I will make the subject of mastery or I will realize that I'm not all that into back-end and focus on honing my skills in React and Redux.
