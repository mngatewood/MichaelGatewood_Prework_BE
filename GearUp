## Reflection
1.  Empathy is the ability to put yourself in somebody elseâ€™s shoes and understand how they feel.  As a married man with a child, empathy plays an important role in my life as a husband and father.  Empathy is paramount in establishing and maintaining good relationships.  When my wife or son are having a problem, they know that they talk to me without fear of criticism or judgement.  When life deals challenges, you aren't always talking it over to solicit a solution.  It is as important to show understanding as it is to lend a helping hand to friends and family through tough times.

2.  Software is developed and purchased to solve problems experienced by potential customers.  Empathy allows us to better understand the needs of our customers, thereby fostering better products and innovation.  Better understanding of customer needs results in an improved design and testing procedures.  Additionally, empathy promotes good relationships with coworkers, superiors, and subordinates.  Good relationships are the key to any successful business, including software development.

3.  In business and our personal lives, we interact with others from different backgrounds, different perspectives, and different feelings.  Software development is a team effort; so you can rest assured that you will be working different personalities.  Developing software and meeting deadlines can be a challenge in and of itself.  Practicing empathy alleviates inter-personal obstacles by gaining trust among coworkers.

4.  When I deployed to Kuwait, my team was built with team members from organizations all over Nevada only months prior to our mobilization.  Due to the short timeframe and the sheer number of requirements that had to be met before deploying, we didn't have much time to get to know each other or "gel" as a cohesive team.  We all had different strengths and weaknesses (self included) and little time to learn our roles and responsibilities.  We accomplished our mission because we all exhibited empathy to one another.  Empathy and self-awareness helped to dictate our individual roles and the trust we had established early on resulted in the cohesive efficiencies that we needed in order to be successful.

5.  I find it challenging to practice good empathy when I feel that my perspective is ignored or misunderstood.  This is often displayed by the other party with hostility, vulgarity, and/or a raised voice.  This obviously creates an uncomfortable environment for both of us and it is important to fight the instinctive tendency to react with similar behavior.  When you feel you are being attacked or disrespected, it can be difficult to show concern with another's feelings or perspective.  The key is to remain calm and show active listening.  With practice, it is possible to diffuse a difficult situation with empathy.
